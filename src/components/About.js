      <h1>Who is The GrapeVine?</h1>
      <p>
        The purpose of The GrapeVine is to bring people together on a dedicated
        social space where people can share their love of Australian wine and
        learn a tip or two along the way. This benefits the community of wine
        consumers at all levels to then be able to try recommended wines by
        those who have shared and contributed within the community.
      </p>

      <p>
        We aim to share a number of new wines each week for people to try and
        share their experience and tips with others in a safe and friendly
        online space.
      </p>
